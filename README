# A game is played with the same 4 players until one of the two teams scores over 500
# points.
# Players 1 & 3 form a team, as do players 2 & 4.

# A round is a set of 13 hands in which players accumulate tricks to determine which teams
# made their bids or not, and similarly which teams obtained sandbags.

# A hand played is a single set of 4 cards, 1 card from each player, to determine who wins
# the trick from that round.
